# Stroke Prediction
In my project, I've developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various demographic and health-related factors. Leveraging data from a comprehensive dataset, I trained a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) using R, incorporating features such as age, gender, hypertension status, and average glucose level. This model serves as the backbone of a RESTful API built with Plumber, allowing seamless integration into web applications and other systems. With this API, users can submit patient information and receive real-time predictions regarding stroke risk. Additionally, I've provided detailed documentation on how to use the API, along with sample code snippets for easy integration. Through this project, I aim to empower healthcare professionals and researchers with a valuable tool for early detection and intervention in stroke cases.
